# Kahoot Keyboard Shortcuts Safari
Add custom keyboard shortcuts to Kahoot. Bind specific keys to shapes and answer faster without having to move the mouse.

## Installation

The easiest way to install is via the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1534465095) for Safari.

To install from source, clone the repo and follow the [instructions from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_app_extensions/building_a_safari_app_extension#2957926)

The repo for the Firefox and Chrome version that this repo is based off of is available at [lkellar/kahoot](https://github.com/lkellar/kahoot).

## Usage
By default, the shortcuts are mapped to

* Triangle/Red: O
* Diamond/Blue: P
* Circle/Yellow: S
* Square/Green: D

To change these settings, go to Safari Preferences and hit the preferences button for "Kahoot Keyboard Shortcuts".

Alternatively, if the extension is in your toolbar, you can change your shortcuts from there.

Once finished updating the shortcuts, hit save, and the new shortcuts will instantly be used.
